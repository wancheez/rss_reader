## Synchronization

Feeds' content is being synchronized in an unattended manner with help of update-service. Period of synchronization based on ttl-parameter of a feed.
In a several failed attempts, the synchronization process will be stopped. Manual synchronization will be required.
Failed to update feeds might be found in /feeds/failed.

## How to start

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Testing

In the root dir:
```
pytest
```

## Implementation details

The service is written with Python 3.x. 
MongoDB is used to store feeds info. MongoEngine as ORM.
Feed synchronization is implemented in the separate service with pydantic.
Redis is used as a broker for pydantic and storing attempts info.
The service is designed to be loose coupled with Representation, Model and Service layers.


## Configuration

If required, synchronization might be adjusted in the conf/conf.py file.


## TODO

Implement authorization with password.
Switch to async MongoDB ORM.
